##### *International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology*
I am the primary author of the journal article on a healthcare-as-a-service application which solves the problem of data integrity using blockchain technology. It is about the storage of healthcare data of individuals in a centralized blockchain database by which data tampering is avoided by anonymous people. The records from the Database are then verified using the data from the blockchain.
